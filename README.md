NOTICE — Assets & Trademarks
----------------------------
This repository is a convenience collection of assets files used as references for [my personal README repository](https://github.com/Zemasterkrom/zemasterkrom).
**I do not own** any of the assets contained here. Each asset is the trademark and/or
copyrighted artwork of its respective owner.

Please consult the brand, licenses and trademark guidelines linked in [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](ATTRIBUTIONS.md) before
using any asset. The license in [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) applies only to files that I own (README,
scripts, metadata). It **does not** grant any permission to use the logos or any
related trademarks — you must follow the original owners' trademark policies referenced in [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](ATTRIBUTIONS.md): some policies may prohibit the modification or redistribution of assets. Assets marked as "retrieved" may have been used for modification purposes in this project, in which case this will be stated. Modified assets remain subject to the licences and trademark guidelines associated with the original assets depending on the used license.
